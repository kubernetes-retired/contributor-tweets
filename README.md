# Kubernetes Contributor Tweets

Welcome to Contributor Tweets!

This repository is part of the automation, to tweet from the [K8sContributors](https://twitter.com/k8scontributors) twitter account. If you are looking at posting a tweet from the K8sContributors account, please follow the [instructions](#posting-a-new-tweet) below.

This project is currently owned and maintained by the [SIG Contribex Marketing Team](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/communication/marketing-team).

## Automation

The automation is based on [twitter-together](https://github.com/gr2m/twitter-together) project.

> twitter-together is a GitHub Action that utilizes text files to publish tweets from a GitHub repository. Rather than tweeting directly, GitHubâ€™s pull request review process encourages more collaboration, Twitter activity and editorial contributions by enabling everyone to submit tweet drafts to a project

Everytime a PR with a new `.tweet` file gets merged, the contents of the file will used to send out a tweet **instantly** from the K8sContributors account.

The automation also supports tweet scheduling with the help of [merge-schedule-action](https://github.com/gr2m/merge-schedule-action). To schedule a tweet for a specific day, enter the command `\schedule yyyy-mm-dd` in the PR description. This will tweet on the given day at 12 AM GMT. 

Note: The schedule feature is not supported for PR from fork repos. Therefore, this feature should be investigated further and should be used with caution

Thanks to the team behind **twitter-together** for putting together a wonderful open-source project.

## Posting a new tweet

1. Create a [new issue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/contributor-tweets/issues/new/choose) in this repository.
2. Follow the issue template and fill in the prompts.
3. Click submit.
4. If you have exceeded the maximum length, you will be thrown with an error comment. Please fix and comment `/validate` on the issue to restart the automation process.
5. If everything is fine, you will be given a pull request link in the issue.
6. Once the PR is approved and merged, the tweet is sent out from the [K8sContributors account](https://twitter.com/k8scontributors)


## Notes

- Only newly created files are handled, deletions, updates or renames are ignored.
- *.tweet files will not be created for tweets sent out directly from twitter.com
- If you need to rename an existing tweet file, please do so locally using git mv old_filename new_filename, otherwise it may occur as deleted and added which would trigger a new tweet.
